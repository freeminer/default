Minetest Game (abbreviated MTG) is a simple and peaceful sandbox game, with no
real goals or built-in enemy mobs.

While it provides a basic gameplay experience out of the box, it is best played
with mods.

Minetest Game is currently in maintenance-only mode, meaning it will not see new
gameplay features or anything else that breaks compatibility (See
[#2710](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/issues/2710)).
