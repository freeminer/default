The main game for the Freeminer game engine [default]
==========================================================

To build the wholeness of the Freeminer project, insert this repository as
  /games/default
in the Freeminer Engine.

The Freeminer Engine can be found in:
  https://github.com/freeminer/freeminer/

Compatibility
--------------
The default github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of freeminer.

Additionally, when the freeminer engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.1), default is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, default is packaged and made available in
  http://freeminer.org
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
